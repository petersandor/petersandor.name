## Preface

This post is mostly a rant about how I discovered a potential firmware security vulnerability in my newest laptop and how I dealt with it.

### Asus Vivobook X15

Earlier this year I got myself a new laptop — an **[Asus Vivobook X15](https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/vivobook/vivobook-15x-oled-x1503-12th-gen-intel/)**. It's a surprisingly powerful laptop with a 12th-generation Intel processor, priced at around 900 EUR.

### CPU

See how this laptop's CPU compares against other ones commonly used in laptops:

  </div>
  <div className="italic text-xs">Almost as good as Apple M1 Max!</div>
</div>

Its single-thread performance:

</div>

I was delighted with this little CPU.

This laptop was intended to be a replacement for my similarly priced, 12-and-a-half-year-old desktop PC, which I turned into a NAS (that's a whole other post). I'm not going to compare the performance between the two since more than a decade of innovations render almost every component obsolete by default. The CPU alone is at least 89.90% faster.

### GPU

There's no dedicated GPU in the model that I own (there are other models). With dual channel memory, you can unlock [Iris Xe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Xe#Integrated_graphics), which is good enough for light gaming (it can use up to 50% of system RAM for itself though). It can even run some modern-ish games at 720p.[^1] Without RAM in dual channel mode, you would have to stick with the slower Intel UHD which has only 128 MB of memory.[^2]

### Firmware security

I've been learning about firmware security and side-channel attacks on computers and smartphones since 2014. There have been many impressive vulnerabilities discovered over the years, especially in _x86_-based platforms. Some of the notable ones were in **Intel Management Engine**, which has been part of virtually all Intel platforms since 2008. It's a secondary system that is running its own OS based on MINIX[^3], with special access to network interface and memory. Its main purpose is out-of-band remote management in an enterprise setting, [DRM (secure video path)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine#Disabling_the_ME) and more.

> The Intel Management Engine is a proprietary, mostly undocumented, firmware system that provides many extraneous features that are generally not usable or useful to our users, with multiple known vulnerabilities that compromise the entire system.[^4]

Regular users, however, will have to use the computers with these extraneous features, which had several critical vulnerabilities in it in the past, with no way to disable them. I was curious whether my Vivobook X15 is also vulnerable, so I decided to scan it with [Intel® Converged Security and Management Engine Version Detection Tool](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19392/intel-converged-security-and-management-engine-version-detection-tool-intel-csmevdt.html):

  </div>
  <div className="italic text-xs">This system is vulnerable</div>
</div>

It may be a false positive since the tool is a bit outdated, but just to be sure, I reached out to Asus support in April this year, and they responded by saying that they will address it in the next BIOS update. About 3 months later, a new version _305_ was released, which I installed.

  </div>
  <div className="italic text-xs">Intel Security update included</div>
</div>

I ran the Intel CSME tool again and it still reported that the machine is vulnerable, so I contacted Asus support again. They replied two days later saying that this would be fixed in the next BIOS version _306_, which I'm still awaiting. I'll update this post once it's released.

#### Conclusions

There are numerous initiatives (including Google's[^5]) working on disabling and removing Intel ME. You can try flashing custom BIOS like [coreboot](https://coreboot.org) or [libreboot](https://libreboot.org) with disabled Intel ME firmware blobs, but keep in mind that not every motherboard is supported. Back in 2018, I flashed locally built **coreboot** binary with Raspberry Pi and [flashrom](https://flashrom.org) on my ThinkPad T420 where I now run [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org) which enables further mitigations on known vulnerabilities by disabling certain CPU features.

You can also try to switch to AMD, although there's an equivalent of Intel ME which is called [AMD PSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Platform_Security_Processor) (albeit less powerful/vulnerable).

### Update (28-01-2024)

Looks like this issue has been fixed in BIOS version 306. I've updated my laptop and the latest Intel CSME tool (version 9.0.3.0) no longer reports any vulnerabilities.
