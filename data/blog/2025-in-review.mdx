Not much has changed since 2024, the path of continuous learning never ends. Time continues to accelerate, and I'm aging faster than I'd like. At the very least, I kept monitoring the situation.

The year was dominated by migrations, upgrades, and the usual assortment of technical rabbit holes.

I became a team leader and handled more responsibility at work than ever before. My home infrastructure grew into a small personal cloud.

## At work

### General

- Became a team leader
- As an SME, I helped review applications for internal certifications
- Survived some "resource actions"
- Read [Modern Angular](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-angular/9781633436923/) on O'Reilly for free (before IBM ended the enterprise plan[^1]), highly recommend the book

### Technical achievements

- Angular app development and maintenance
  - migration of a massive legacy app from Angular 14 to 19
  - developed a bunch of features and fixed ~274 issues
  - adopted Signals and new template control flow
  - integrated some Web Components
  - cleaned up legacy modal implementation (routable modals on top of modals, anyone?)
    - combining two separate modal implementations (legacy and IBM Carbon Components)
  - modernized some parts of the app by migrating to IBM Carbon Components (completely new designs)

  Notes:
  - app is going to be 8 years old in 2026, and it is still going strong, which is a testament to the power of Angular and the dedication of the team maintaining it
  - received early access to IBM Bob on the 30th of December (better late than never)
- CKEditor 5 custom plugin development and maintenance
  - Developed file uploader/manager/viewer plugin, which also supports switching between embed and inline view in the document
  - Upgraded our custom builds to v46 (a couple of breaking changes here and there)

### **Stats**

- 144 hours of chatting on Slack
- 189 hours of MS Teams meetings
- 382 hours in IDE + terminal (still trad-coding majority of the time)

## Home improvements

- New plants (multiple snake plants and a single ZZ plant)
- Heated desk mat (such a life hack)
- SwitchBot Meter Pro CO2 air quality monitor and a regular CO detector
- Another used car

### NAS & infrastructure

TrueNAS proved itself after more than 3 years of use, I'm really happy with it.

- Added more HDDs for redundancy and migrated apps (dropped TrueCharts)
- Set up my first Tailscale network + nginx
- Started using Immich
- Continued running a small fleet of archiving and automation tools

### Personal workstation

My [ASUS VivoBook](/blog/asus-vivobook-x15) keeps working fine, but I think I finally decided to switch to macOS since I became such an Apple fanboy. Also, it took ~20 hours to update Windows to 24H2, after multiple failed attempts.

## Parts of my daily workflow

- Continued daily note-taking and time tracking
- Cross-posting experiments with Fedica
- Completed LeetCode challenges for 365 days

## Random achievements

- Read 1798 Medium articles (mostly about programming)
- Carried ~740 kg of groceries in 2-3 shopping bags (less than last year since I started using cars more)
- Notable abbreviation of the year: NOBUS - nobody but us

## What's next

- Switching from Windows to macOS (final step in completing my Apple ecosystem)
- More learning
- More AI automation in daily life (I feel so inspired thanks to OpenClaw)
- New side projects (obviously)
- House renovation (finally, hopefully, maybe)
