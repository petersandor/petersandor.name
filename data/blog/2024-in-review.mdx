I started the year with a residual flu carried over from the previous year, still trying to solve some [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges (the first time I participated).

I continued the trend from previous years when I started revisiting the basics of programming, spending some time learning and coding with LC-3 assembly and a bit of C.

In 2024, I spent a considerable amount of time on various code challenges and several <abbr title="Data Structures and Algorithms">DSA</abbr> courses. Yes, I was grinding LeetCode and HackerRank for fun. This year I will try to invest more time into actual side projects.

## At work

- Still working on the same knowledge sharing Angular app, the project is growing (but also aging), and it is amazing to witness it all firsthand
  - Stack hasn't changed one bit, it's mostly just Angular (TypeScript, RxJS, ngrx)
  - Helped develop some more wonderful features with [IBM Carbon Components](https://carbondesignsystem.com/)
- Worked on two new [CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/) plugins, migrated several legacy plugins from older versions, so I had to maintain feature parity despite the differences in the SDK APIs between the versions (not negligible)
- Participated in an internal <abbr title="Capture The Flag">CTF</abbr> event again (finished 13th out of 49)
  - At least I succeeded at some reverse engineering challenges

## Home improvements

- Got heat pumps installed in the bedroom and living room
- Installed outdoor solar lights, replaced an old wired one
- Got the garden and chicken coop cleaned up (a literal truckload of dry branches and other biowaste)
- Got a walnut tree trimmed; it was dangerously big
- A bit overdue, but I upgraded my wired <abbr title="local area network">LAN</abbr> to 1 Gbps

## NAS

- Installed some new HDDs (16 TB + 8 TB)
  - Downloaded 2TB of reddit data (single torrent, data up to 2023-12), it took almost a month to download
    - adding an additional ~45 GB of new data per month (separate torrents)
  - Downloaded backups of english Wikipedia (158 GB total), StackOveflow DB (55 GB), StackExchange (83 GB), HackerNews (9 GB, data up to 2020 only)
  - Downloaded dozens of images of various Linux distros for netbooting
- Bought my first <abbr title="Uninterruptible power supply">UPS</abbr>
  - Set up a local NUT server so I can track UPS status from multiple devices on the network
- Installed multiple archiving apps such as [Tube Archivist](https://www.tubearchivist.com/) and [ArchiveBox](https://archivebox.io/) (running on a Kubernetes cluster together with many other apps and services)

## Changes in my daily workflow

- Started using [Timing](https://timingapp.com/?lang=en) app (time tracking)
- Started taking notes on a daily basis
- Started using Python more

## New personal projects

I wanted to build something with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), so I decided to create a website to track CVEs. It's basically a dashboard with some charts and a counter of days since the last memory management vulnerability was reported, data is fetched from [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities) APIs.

## Random achievements

- Notable abbreviations that I stumbled upon (there were so many)
  - HIPPO: highest paid person's opinion
  - [BLUFFS: Bluetooth Forward and Future Secrecy](https://media.ccc.de/v/37c3-12342-bluffs_bluetooth_forward_and_future_secrecy_attacks_and_defenses)
- Carried a total of almost 2 tonnes of groceries in 2 shopping bags (sometimes 3) in my hands over the year
  - shopped 69 times, averaging in 30 kg of groceries carried per trip (for a distance of ~450 meters)

## What's next

- More learning (it's free!)
- Start new side projects
- Set up a [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) node for long range off-grid comms
- Hoard more data
- Upgrade my NAS hardware (currently using a 15 years old [AMD Athlon II X4 635](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+Athlon+II+X4+635&id=170) CPU)
- Everything else that I didn't get done last year
