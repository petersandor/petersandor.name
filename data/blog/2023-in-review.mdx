## New projects

### Professional

Since May 2017, I have been working on user interfaces for enterprise key management solutions – namely [IBM Enterprise Key Management Foundation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ekmf-web) and then its much improved cloud version – [Unified Key Orchestrator](https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/unified-key-orchestrator/) (which won a [design award](https://medium.com/design-ibm/unified-key-orchestrator-within-ibm-cloud-hyper-protect-crypto-services-wins-red-dot-award-2c1cfeacc49b)).

In January, I had the opportunity to join another, much bigger project. I was ready for a new challenge, so I accepted it.

It is one of the biggest single page applications I have ever worked on, with several hundreds of components and quite complex state management.

I helped develop new features and during the process, I also learned a lot about [CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/) by writing custom plugins for it.

### Personal

I finally got to some side projects that I had on my mind for a long time.

- Learned some [LC-3 assembly](https://github.com/petersandor/tic-tac-toe-lc3) for fun (motivated by [this post](https://www.andreinc.net/2021/12/01/writing-a-simple-vm-in-less-than-125-lines-of-c))
- Started blogging again
- Repurposed my old desktop PC into a [NAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage)

#### GitHub activity

I plan to contribute more to open source repositories this year.

## Events

In March, I participated in an internal [CTF event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) organized by the company, which was great fun. I was impressed by the challenges that the organizers came up with, some of them were left unsolved.  I particularly enjoyed the reverse engineering challenges, and I was excited to be able to utilize and learn about all the tools that are available these days.

I also made sure that I won't miss talks from the latest conferences (both internal and external), I can say that I've seen quite a few presentations and talks on various topics (mostly related to software development and information security).

## New hardware

### Workstation

As I mentioned in my previous post, I've replaced my old desktop with a new laptop. You can read about my experience with it [here](/blog/asus-vivobook-x15).

### Smartwatch

Despite my initial reluctance to ever buying a smartwatch, I decided to try one for its vitals monitoring capabilities and life saving features such as fall/crash detection. There are several reports of people whose lives were saved thanks to a smart watch.

## What's next

Here's a short list of things that I'd like to do this year.

- Get involved in open source projects
- Work on my blog
- Do some 3D stuff again _(I have fond memories creating custom video game maps)_
- Write a combined reflection covering all the previous years
