Peter Šándor is a curious, passionate, experienced software developer and an aspiring electrical engineer. He worked on a variety of projects ranging from Windows anti-virus software, e-commerce, web components libraries, dashboards to cryptography (multi-cloud web key management), multi-purpose single-page applications and CLI tools. 

He is interested in open-source software development since late 2014, and was an early TypeScript adopter (later managed to contribute a small bug fix in the parser/compiler). 

In his spare time he also worked with C++ (Qt framework), he likes reverse engineering and also participated in a CTF once! He started publishing his first websites in 2005.
